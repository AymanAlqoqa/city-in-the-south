# City-of-the-south

## Problem:

Dominic and David believe that people in South London get to work without respective quality, so, they want to use technology to help South Londoners to:

- get work from each other (connecting both online and face-to-face as part of that process).
- offer and receive better quality and more sustainable work (we created the Growth Pathway to help businesses to become established, successful and ethical as partnerships and/or employers (‘establishment’ to involve training, mentoring, crowdfunding and incubation; ‘success’ to involve tailoring product-market fit South London buyers and developing the market-place in a sharing economy; ‘ethical’ to be about treating people fairly and considering their longer-term future and wellbeing).

## Goals:

- Help local people to get work from each other.
- Save the rights for the workers.
- Help ordinary people to think about investing or starting their own business.
- Help local business to get good quality workers.
- help people to get work with good quality.
- help small business to growing.
